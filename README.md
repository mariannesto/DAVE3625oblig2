Use case: Tesla
Algorithm type: Linear regression

We chose to solve this assignment using a linear regression algorithm. This was chosen, rather than classifaction, because we are supposed to predict numbers: the stock price. We thought classification would be more suitable if we were supposed to end up with an output that was i.e. supposed to tell us that it would be higher or lower (true/false, two possible outcomes). 

We also thought that maybe a polynomal regression would be suitable for a more accurate outcome (in case of i.e. drop in stock price). But after researching similar problems, we noticed that most of them solved it using linear regression, and realised that it should be possible to get proper feedback from a linear regression as well.
